# Phase 3: Planning

> **Status**: **MANDATORY** — **Approval required before Execution**  
> **Skill**: `/planning`  
> **Back to**: [SOP Checklist](../SOP_COMPLIANCE_CHECKLIST.md)

---

## Purpose

Define what will be built, how it will be verified, and get explicit user approval before execution.

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Approval Gate

> **Execution is BLOCKED until user provides explicit approval**  
> Example: `"👍 APPROVED FOR EXECUTION"`  
> Approval expires after 4 hours — re-approval required if stale.

---

## Quick Checklist

- [ ] Create/update `implementation_plan.md` with proposed changes
- [ ] Perform blast radius analysis for significant changes
- [ ] Define milestones and success criteria
- [ ] **Present plan to user and get explicit approval**
- [ ] Update `task.md` with current objectives

## Detailed Requirements

### Blast Radius Analysis

Progressive disclosure levels:

| Level                   | When to Use          | Includes                                                  |
| ----------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Level 1 (Summary)**   | Quick assessment     | Risk level, affected files count, timeline impact         |
| **Level 2 (Detailed)**  | Development planning | Dependency chains, test coverage gaps, migration needs    |
| **Level 3 (Deep-Dive)** | P0/P1 changes        | Performance implications, security, long-term maintenance |

- [ ] **Level 1**: Quick overview with risk assessment
- [ ] **Level 2**: Module-level analysis if needed
- [ ] **Level 3**: Full architectural review for P0/P1

### Implementation Plan

- [ ] Create/update `implementation_plan.md`
- [ ] Document proposed changes by component
- [ ] Define verification plan (tests, manual validation)
- [ ] Identify rollback procedures

### Milestones

- [ ] Define success criteria for each phase
- [ ] Establish validation checkpoints
- [ ] Document A/B testing requirements if applicable

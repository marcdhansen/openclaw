# Phase 6: Retrospective

> **Status**: **MANDATORY** — Strategic learning after finalization  
> **Skill**: `/reflect`  
> **Validation**: `check_protocol_compliance.py --retrospective`  
> **Back to**: [SOP Checklist](../SOP_COMPLIANCE_CHECKLIST.md)

---

## Purpose

Capture strategic learnings, provide handoff summary, and ensure continuous improvement.

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Reflect Required

> **Run `/reflect` to generate `.reflection_input.json`**  
> This is BLOCKING — session cannot complete without it.

---

## Quick Checklist

- [ ] **Reflect**: Run `/reflect` to generate `.reflection_input.json`
- [ ] **Memory Sync**: Persist learnings to AutoMem/OpenViking
- [ ] **Handoff**: Include PR link, issues created/closed, next steps
- [ ] **Plan Cleanup**: Clear approval marker in `task.md`
- [ ] **Orchestrator Check**: `check_protocol_compliance.py --retrospective`

---

## Handoff Summary

Provide clear summary including:

- [ ] Work completed and deliverables
- [ ] **PR Link**: Link to GitHub Pull Request
- [ ] Beads issues created/closed (specific IDs)
- [ ] Recommended next steps

### Strategic Questions

Address these during reflection:

| Question             | Focus Areas                                  |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Cognitive Load**   | Can manual SOP steps be automated?           |
| **Design Patterns**  | What patterns should be formalized?          |
| **Emergent Methods** | Better approaches discovered during session? |

### RBT Analysis

- [ ] **Roses** (🌹): What worked well?
- [ ] **Buds** (🌱): What could be improved?
- [ ] **Thorns** (🌿): What failed repeatedly?

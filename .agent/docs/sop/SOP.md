# 🌐 Global Agent Rules: Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)

These rules define the universal behavior and operational standards for agents across all workspaces.

## 🏁 Initialization Phase

**MANDATORY: Run at the start of every session.**

1. **Isolation Check**: Ensure you are working on a dedicated branch (not `main` or `master`) and ideally in a dedicated worktree (e.g., path contains `task-`).
2. **Initialization Validation**: Verify required tool versions (e.g., `git` 2.25+, `bd` 0.40+) and workspace integrity (existence of `.git`, `.agent`, `.beads`) using the Orchestrator.
3. **Context Check**: Read `.agent/rules/ROADMAP.md` and `.agent/rules/ImplementationPlan.md` to understand current state.
4. **Status Check**: Run `bd ready` to see active tasks.
5. **Issue Check**: Ensure a Beads issue exists for the current objective. If not, create one using `bd create`.
6. **Implementation Readiness**: **MANDATORY** validation before starting any work:

```yaml
Implementation_Readiness_Checklist:
  Beads_Issue_Exists: false
  Feature_Branch_Active: false
  Baseline_Performance_Documented: false
  TDD_Requirements_Prepared: false
  Performance_Assertions_Defined: false

Blocking_Behavior: Any "false" → WORK BLOCKED
```

1. **Orchestrator**: Use the `Orchestrator` skill to verify that all Initialization procedures (including Git isolation) are strictly followed. Run: `python ~/.gemini/antigravity/skills/Orchestrator/scripts/check_protocol_compliance.py --init`. **NOTE**: Approvals in `task.md` are only valid for 4 hours; stale timestamps will block initialization.
2. **Navigation Check**: Verify readability of `~/.agent/docs/GLOBAL_INDEX.md` and confirm access to the current project's entry in the index.
3. **Markdown Check**: Run `markdownlint` on planning documents to ensure rendering integrity.
4. **Quality Gate Validation**: **MANDATORY** automated validation that cannot be bypassed:

```bash
# Validate TDD compliance (MANDATORY)
python ~/.gemini/antigravity/skills/Orchestrator/scripts/validate_tdd_compliance.py

# Validate performance requirements (MANDATORY)
python ~/.gemini/antigravity/skills/Orchestrator/scripts/validate_performance_requirements.py

# Verify all required artifacts exist (MANDATORY)
python ~/.gemini/antigravity/skills/Orchestrator/scripts/validate_required_artifacts.py
```

**Blocking Behavior**: Any validation failure → SESSION BLOCKED until resolved 9. **Linked Repository Check**: If this task requires changes to global repositories (`~/.gemini`, `~/.agent`) or other external repositories, declare them in `task.md`:

```yaml
Linked_Repositories:
  - path: ~/.gemini
    branch: feat/your-feature-branch
  - path: ~/.agent
    branch: feat/your-feature-branch
```

1. **Initialization**: Formulate the initial task list and announce the starting objective.
2. **Execution Handshake**: For high-impact or long-running tasks, explicitly list the next steps and wait for a "Go" signal before initiating execution.

## ⚙️ Execution Phase

**GUIDELINES: Operational standards during execution.**

1. **Living Document**: Keep `task.md` updated as the living source of truth.
2. **Spec-Driven TDD**: Every functional change must start with a specification and a failing test case (Red phase) before implementation (Green phase). **MANDATORY**: All features must include performance benchmarking with measurable speed, memory, and scalability assertions.
3. **Internal Research**: If a step fails, investigate logs and documentation before asking the user.
4. **Decision Log**: Record significant decisions in `implementation_plan.md` or `walkthrough.md`.
5. **Dynamic Adjustment**: If the plan needs to change, switch to PLANNING mode and update artifacts first.
6. **UI Testing**: For code changes that affect the UI, the agent must test the state by running the browser and monitoring the output. Only after automatic UI validation should the user be asked to manually verify the UI.
7. **UI Integrity**: Use Playwright to verify any changes that affect the UI. This is a standard rule for UI modifications.
8. **Container Management**: If it is necessary to bring up containers, run Docker without Docker Desktop to minimize resource consumption (e.g., use CLI-based alternatives like OrbStack or Colima).
9. **Value-Driven Complexity Scaling**: For new feature development, prefer to begin with simple modifications. Only after the value of the new feature has been demonstrated will we proceed to more complex implementations.

## 🏆 Finalization Phase

**MANDATORY: Run at the end of every session.**

1. **Beads Update**: File issues for remaining work and close finished ones.
2. **Quality Gates**: Proactively run all project-specific linters and tests.
   - **Python**: `uv run ruff check --fix .` and `uv run ruff format .`
   - **WebUI**: `cd lightrag_webui && bun run lint`
   - **Unified**: `pre-commit run --all-files`
3. **Orchestrator Verification**: **CRITICAL**. Run the Orchestrator Finalization check to ensure everything is compliant.

   ```bash
   python ~/.gemini/antigravity/skills/Orchestrator/scripts/check_protocol_compliance.py --finalize
   ```

   **BLOCKING**: Do NOT push or hand off if the Orchestrator reports warnings or critical errors.

4. **Testing**: Run project-specific linters, tests, and `markdownlint` on all modified `.md` files. **MANDATORY**: All performance-related benchmarks must include latency/speed metrics in addition to accuracy metrics to enable speed-accuracy tradeoff analysis.
5. **Web UI Verification**: Run `bun run build` in `LightRAG/lightrag_webui` and verify the UI is functional if any frontend changes were made.
6. **Sync & Push**:

   ```bash
   bd sync
   git add .
   git commit -m "chore: save session work"
   git push
   ```

7. **Cleanup**: Delete any temporary files/directories created during the current task (e.g., `test_output.txt`, `debug_import.py`, orphaned logs) and close any browser tabs opened for testing.
8. **Orchestrator**: Use the `Orchestrator` skill to verify that all Finalization procedures are strictly followed. Run: `python ~/.gemini/antigravity/skills/Orchestrator/scripts/check_protocol_compliance.py --finalize`
9. **Verification**: Ensure `git status` shows up-to-date with origin.
10. **Linked Repository Validation**: For each declared or auto-detected linked repository:
    - [ ] Verify changes are on a dedicated branch (not `main` or `master`)
    - [ ] Verify PR has been created (`gh pr list`)
    - [ ] Verify commit messages include the primary task's Beads Issue ID
    - [ ] **MANDATORY**: Infrastructure changes in global repositories MUST have a dedicated Beads issue.
11. **Handoff**: Provide a clear summary of what was done, **list specific Beads issues created**, what skills were used, any suggestions for skill management, and what should be done next.
12. **Self-Evolution**: Execute the `reflect` skill (e.g., `/reflect`) to analyze the session for "memories"—specific corrections, preferences, or tool friction—and update relevant `SKILL.md` files or global rules to permanently implement the "correct once, never again" philosophy.
13. **Clear Plan Approval**: Remove or neutralize the `## Approval` marker in `task.md` to prevent accidental auto-starts in the next session.
14. **Retrospective**: Include a comprehensive retrospective summary after all work is completed. This should cover:
    - **Process Review**: Successes and friction points in the development cycle.
    - **Lessons Learned**: Significant technical or strategic discoveries.
    - **Strategy Evolution**: Suggestions for rule modifications, skill improvements, or anti-pattern logging.

## 🏗️ 3-Tier Planning Strategy

1. **ROADMAP.md**: High-level navigation and current objective status (stored in `.agent/rules/`).
2. **ImplementationPlan.md**: Detailed technical breakdown and phase tracking (stored in `.agent/rules/`).
3. **Beads (`bd`)**: Granular task management and dependency tracking.

## 🧪 Spec-Driven TDD Protocol

All development MUST follow the Spec-Driven Test-Driven Development (TDD) cycle:

1. **Specification**: Define the objective, requirements, and success criteria in `task.md` or `ImplementationPlan.md`.
2. **Test Selection/Creation**:
   - Identify existing tests that should pass.
   - Create new test cases (Python `pytest` or WebUI `playwright`) that verify the new functionality or reproduce the bug.
   - **MANDATORY**: Run the tests and confirm they FAIL (Red phase).
3. **Implementation**: Write the minimum amount of code required to make the tests pass.
4. **Verification**: Run the tests and confirm they PASS (Green phase).
5. **Refactor**: Improve the code while ensuring tests remain green.
6. **Audit**: For LLM-based features, run benchmarks/audits to ensure no regression in quality (accuracy, latency). **MANDATORY** for ALL features: Document speed-accuracy tradeoffs and validate performance claims with measurable benchmarks.

## 📊 **Performance Benchmarking Requirements (MANDATORY)**

### **All Features Must Include**

1. **Baseline Measurements**: Document current system performance before changes
2. **Performance Assertions**: Define measurable speed, memory, and scalability requirements
3. **Benchmark Tests**: Create tests that validate performance claims
4. **Tradeoff Analysis**: Document speed vs resource vs accuracy tradeoffs
5. **Regression Prevention**: Ensure no performance degradation

### **Quality Gate Validation**

```yaml
Performance_Requirements:
  - Baseline_Documented: false
  - Performance_Assertions: false
  - Benchmark_Tests_Created: false
  - Tradeoffs_Analyzed: false
  - No_Regression_Confirmed: false

Blocking_Behavior: Any "false" → SESSION BLOCKED
```

### **Required Artifacts**

- `tests/feature_*_benchmarks.py` - Performance validation tests
- `docs/feature_*_tradeoffs.md` - Speed vs resource analysis
- Performance measurements in test documentation
- Baseline comparison reports

## 🐚 Beads Field Manual

- `bd init`: Initialize Beads in a project.
- `bd ready`: List tasks with no unsatisfied blockers.
- `bd sync`: Flush current state to Git and push to remote.
- `bd doctor --fix`: Check and fix common database issues.
- **Protocol for Parallel Agents**:
  1. **Unique Assignment**: Explicitly assign issues using labels (e.g., `bd update <id> --set-labels agent:alpha`) to prevent overlap.
  2. **Frequent Sync**: Run `bd sync` at the start of Initialization and end of Finalization to maintain state consistency across agent instances.
  3. **Dependency Management**: Use `bd dep` to establish clear work orders, ensuring agents do not start tasks with unsatisfied blockers.
  4. **Health Maintenance**: Proactively run `bd doctor --fix` if any database locks or sync conflicts are detected.
- **Git Isolation for Parallel Agents**:
  1. **Branch-per-Task**: Each agent must work on a dedicated branch (e.g., `git checkout -b task/lightrag-123`).
  2. **Explicit Staging**: Never use `git add .`. Stage only the specific files modified (e.g., `git add tests/test_highlight.py`).
  3. **Worktree Strategy**: For simultaneous work on the same machine, use `bd worktree create <name>` to isolate filesystem changes.

## 📝 Markdown Standards

- **Style Guides**: Always apply common Markdown style guides (e.g., consistent headers, list markers, and spacing).
- **Scannability**: Always place progress indicators (e.g., [x], [ ], ✅, ❌) on the **left** of the text.
- **Task Lists**: For checkboxes to render correctly, they **must** be part of a list (e.g., `- [ ]` or `* [x]`) and **must** have a space between the closing bracket `]` and the following text. They should not be used in headers.
- **Linting**: Use a markdown linter (e.g., `markdownlint`) to verify document integrity before finishing tasks. **Exception**: Relax MD013 (line-length) for lines containing Mermaid diagrams, complex tables, or long URLs where manual wrapping would degrade readability.

- **Path Portability**: Prefer **relative paths** (e.g., `../docs/foo.md`) over absolute paths (`/Users/...`) for internal links and images to ensure cross-workspace compatibility.

## 🧬 Self-Evolution Strategy

- **Preference Capture**: Always record user preferences (e.g., "beeps for input") in this file.
- **Anti-Pattern Logging**: Document sequences that lead to failure (e.g., "avoiding bd edit").
- **Proactive Improvement**: Fix broken links and formatting issues in planning docs without being asked.
- **Global Strategy**: Refer to [SELF_EVOLUTION_GLOBAL.md](SELF_EVOLUTION_GLOBAL.md) for universal patterns.
- **Nomenclature**: Refer to [NOMENCLATURE.md](NOMENCLATURE.md) for detailed definitions of modern agentic terms (Initialization, Execution, Finalization).
- **Atomic Start Protocol**: Never write a line of code or a plan without a specific Beads ID. When building compliance tools (like Orchestrator), you must _manually_ simulate the compliance check before starting work to avoid the "Bootstrap Paradox".

## Agent Memories

- An automated test has passed ONLY when it has been automatically run and has passed successfully.
- The user prefers systematic Python test scripts integrated into the standard test suite (pytest) over ad-hoc shell scripts for verification tasks.
- **Protocol**: ALWAYS search the web for potential solutions to tool errors before asking the user for intervention.
- **Testing**: Local test environments with local LLMs often require significantly higher timeouts (120s-300s) than default configurations (30s).
- **WTU (Wrap This Up)**: When the user says "let's wrap this up" or "WTU", explicitly verify that all steps in the **Finalization** checklist have been completed successfully before ending the session.

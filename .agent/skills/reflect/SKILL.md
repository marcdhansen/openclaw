# Reflect & Improve

## Goal

Implement "correct once, never again" philosophy by analyzing current session for "memories"—specific corrections, coding preferences, or logic improvements—and permanently documenting them into relevant `SKILL.md` files. This ensures that every session contributes to the system's collective intelligence.

## Enhanced Features

The reflect skill now includes **protocol integration** to ensure agents understand quality requirements and can capture protocol-related learnings effectively.

## Usage

```bash
/reflect              # Original reflection
/reflect enhanced      # Enhanced reflection with protocol context
python .agent/skills/reflect/enhanced_reflection.py
```

## 🔍 Strategic Analysis Questions

During reflection, agents should explicitly address these strategic questions:

### Organizational Debt & Artifact Hygiene

> **QUESTION**: Did this session introduce organizational debt (git noise, redundant files, non-standard artifact naming)? If so, how can we automate the prevention of this debt?

Consider:

- Multi-commit PRs that should have been squashed
- Orphaned temporary files or logs
- Inconsistent artifact naming or locations
- Redundant logic or documentation gaps

### Cognitive Load Reduction

> **QUESTION**: Are there parts of the SOP where the agent's cognitive load could be reduced by using scripts?

Consider:

- Manual steps in Initialization/Finalization that could be automated
- Repeated decision points that could have default behaviors
- Complex validations that could be scripted
- Information gathering that could be pre-collected

### Design Patterns & Refactoring

> **QUESTION**: Identify design patterns and recommended refactoring strategies.
>
> **CRITICAL**: Explicitly list any code identified during this session that should be refactored (e.g., monolithic scripts, complexity hotspots).

Consider:

- Emerging patterns that should be formalized as skills
- Template-based approaches to reduce boilerplate
- Code/workflow duplication that could be consolidated
- Anti-patterns observed during the session
- Large monolithic files (e.g., >1000 lines) needing decomposition

### Multi-Agent Collaboration

> **QUESTION**: What improvements could enhance parallel agent workflows?

Consider:

- Task decomposition opportunities
- Explicit dependency declarations
- Session handoff optimization
- Resource contention reduction

### SOP Evaluation & Simplification

> **QUESTION**: Evaluate the standard operating procedure (SOP), with special attention to looking for ways to make the process simpler, less error prone, and with a lower cognitive load for agents.

Consider:

- Process simplification opportunities (remove unnecessary steps)
- Error prevention mechanisms (automated validation, guardrails)
- Cognitive load reduction (default behaviors, reduced decision points)
- Automation opportunities (replace manual steps with scripts)
- Documentation clarity (make instructions more concise and unambiguous)
- Workflow bottlenecks (identify and eliminate process friction points)

## Error Handling

If reflection fails:

1. Check git repository status
2. Verify beads availability
3. Check workspace directory structure
4. Review system permissions

### 🚨 Fixed Issues

### 🛡️ EOF Error Resolved

- **Problem**: Enhanced reflection script failed with "EOF when reading a line" in non-interactive environments
- **Root Cause**: Script used `input()` without proper non-interactive fallback detection
- **Solution**: Added robust non-interactive mode with JSON stdin support
- **Usage**: `python enhanced_reflection.py --fallback` or pipe JSON data via stdin

**Implementation Details:**

- Enhanced `_capture_reflection()` to support both interactive and fallback modes
- Added `--fallback` and `--non-interactive` flags
- Improved stdin JSON parsing with error handling
- Added CLI wrapper for easier usage: `enhanced_reflection_cli.py`

**Fallback Data Format:**

```json
{
  "session_name": "Task Name",
  "outcome": "SUCCESS",
  "duration_hours": 1.0,
  "success_metrics": { "Files Changed": 5 },
  "technical_learnings": ["Learning 1"],
  "challenges_overcome": ["Challenge 1"],
  "protocol_issues": ["Issue 1"],
  "process_improvements": ["Improvement 1"],
  "quantitative_results": { "Metric": "Value" }
}
```

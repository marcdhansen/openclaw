# Planning Skill - P0 Critical Infrastructure

The `planning` skill provides comprehensive planning capabilities for the LightRAG project, featuring blast radius analysis, incremental validation, and value-driven change management. This is a **P0 critical infrastructure** skill that ensures systematic, safe, and measurable feature development.

## 🚀 Usage

```bash
# Primary workflow (Orchestrator integration)
/plan scope <task-id>       # Scope selected task with blast radius analysis
/plan analyze <task-id>     # Detailed analysis and recommendations
/plan proceed <task-id>     # Create implementation plan and milestones
/plan table <task-id>       # Save scoping information, return to task selection

# Direct planning commands
/plan create <feature-name> # Create new feature plan from scratch
/plan validate <plan-id>    # Validate and approve existing plan
/plan track <plan-id>       # Track progress and milestones
/plan rollback <feature>    # Execute rollback procedures

# SOP Simplification Framework
/plan simplify <task-type> [task-id] [description]  # Create SOP simplification proposal
/plan validate-simplification <proposal-path>         # Validate simplification proposal

# Analysis commands
/plan blast-radius <path>   # Quick blast radius analysis
/plan dependencies <target> # Dependency analysis for component
/plan impact <change>      # Comprehensive impact assessment
```

## 🔄 Workflow Integration

### Orchestrator Integration

The planning skill integrates seamlessly with the **Orchestrator** system to provide **post-task-selection planning**:

1. **Task Selection**: Agent selects task using `/next` command
2. **Orchestrator Prompt**: Automatically prompts for planning scoping
3. **Planning Mode**: Agent runs `/plan scope <task-id>` to analyze task
4. **Decision Point**: Agent chooses to proceed with development or table task
5. **Plan Creation**: If proceeding, create implementation plan with milestones

### Enhanced Initialization

The skill enhances the existing Initialization system with planning validation:

```bash
# Enhanced Initialization checks
✅ Basic readiness (existing)
✅ Planning scope completed (new)
✅ Milestones defined (new)
✅ Blast radius analyzed (new)
✅ Rollback procedures validated (new)
```

## 🚦 Incremental Validation System

### Milestone-Based Workflow

```bash
# Development Milestones
1. Development Phase       → Unit Tests + Code Coverage
2. Integration Phase       → Integration Tests + API Compatibility
3. A/B Testing Phase      → Statistical Significance + Performance
4. Production Readiness   → Security Scan + Rollback Validation
5. Production Deployment  → Health Checks + Monitoring Validation
```

### Validation Blocking

- **Failed Milestones Block Progress**: Cannot proceed to next phase
- **Adaptive Thresholds**: Success criteria adjust based on complexity
- **Emergency Bypass**: User approval required with justification
- **Automatic Rollback**: Triggered on critical validation failures

### A/B Testing Integration

- **Statistical Significance**: T-tests, Z-tests, Chi-square analysis
- **Effect Size Measurement**: Cohen's d, correlation coefficients
- **Sample Size Calculation**: Power analysis for minimum detectable effect
- **Decision Rules**: Automated go/no-go based on statistical criteria

## 🔄 SOP Simplification Framework

### Overview

The **SOP Simplification Framework** allows agents to propose modifications to the standard SOP for specific tasks, maintaining quality while reducing friction. This addresses the core challenge of agents bypassing SOP entirely when it feels overly burdensome.

### Process Flow

```bash
# SOP Simplification Workflow
1. Task Analysis → Agent evaluates task complexity and SOP requirements
2. Proposal Creation → Agent creates simplification proposal using template
3. Validation → Automatic validation ensures quality gates preserved
4. User Approval → User chooses between standard and simplified approaches
5. Execution → Follow user-approved approach with retrospective tracking
```

### Core Principles

- **Mandatory Compliance**: Agents must follow either standard OR approved simplified SOP
- **User Control**: All simplifications require explicit user approval
- **Quality Preservation**: Non-negotiable requirements never waived (TDD, code quality, git isolation)
- **Risk-Based Assessment**: All proposals include comprehensive risk analysis

### Proposal Creation

```bash
# Create a simplification proposal
/plan simplify <task-type> [task-id] [description]

# Examples
/plan simplify bug-fix lightrag-123 "Fix memory leak in query processing"
/plan simplify documentation "Update API documentation for new endpoints"
/plan simplify configuration "Add new environment variable for rate limiting"
```

### Proposal Validation

```bash
# Validate proposal before submission
python scripts/validate_simplification.py <proposal-path>

# Validation checks:
✅ Quality gates maintained (TDD, code quality, git isolation)
✅ Justifications provided for all modifications
✅ Risk assessment comprehensive with mitigation strategies
✅ Success criteria clearly defined
❌ Blocked modifications (TDD waivers, quality gate removals)
```

### User Approval Interface

When a valid proposal is created, users see:

```
# SOP Simplification Approval Request

## Task Information
- **Task ID**: lightrag-123
- **Task Type**: Bug Fix

## Proposed Modifications
• Remove performance benchmarking - not relevant for simple bug fixes
• Focus testing on specific bug scenario - avoid full regression overhead

## Approval Options
[A] Approve Standard SOP - Follow full standard procedures
[B] Approve Simplified SOP - Use proposed streamlined approach
[C] Reject - Require agent to revise proposal or use standard approach
```

### Quality Gates (Never Waived)

```yaml
non_negotiable_requirements:
  - TDD Process: Red-Green-Refactor cycle always required
  - Code Quality Gates: Linting, formatting, security scanning preserved
  - Git Isolation: Feature branch and clean working directory required
  - Documentation Updates: Changes documented appropriately
```

### Risk-Based Guidelines

```yaml
simplification_guidelines:
  bug_fix:
    common_simplifications:
      - Skip performance benchmarking for non-performance fixes
      - Focus testing on specific bug scenario
      - Streamline retrospective to technical learnings
    risk_focus: Regression risk and fix effectiveness

  documentation:
    common_simplifications:
      - Skip TDD for pure documentation changes
      - Focus quality gates on documentation integrity
      - Simplify finalization to documentation quality
    risk_focus: Accuracy and clarity of information

  feature_addition:
    common_simplifications:
      - Phase documentation rollouts
      - Focus performance testing on critical paths
    risk_focus: Integration complexity and user adoption
```

### Implementation Integration

The simplification framework integrates with existing systems:

- **Planning Phase**: Proposals created during standard planning process
- **Orchestrator Integration**: Validation enforced before execution
- **Retrospective Enhancement**: Track simplification effectiveness and patterns
- **Beads Integration**: Create tasks for proven simplification patterns

## 🛡️ Safety & Fallback Mechanisms

### Fallback Strategy

The planning skill uses a **Fallback Mechanism** approach:

- **Primary System**: New planning skill as default
- **Fallback Options**: Manual planning, beads-only, direct development
- **Emergency Procedures**: Critical fix bypass with retrospective planning
- **Gradual Migration**: Coexistence period with existing processes

### Conflict Resolution

```python
# Conflict Scenarios & Resolutions
Existing Manual Plan → Merge with planning skill analysis
Beads Task Only → Enhance with blast radius analysis
Emergency Development → Minimal planning + retrospective analysis
Legacy Process Conflict → Configurable preference system
```

### Safety Mechanisms

- **Pre-Deployment Validation**: Rollback procedures verified before deployment
- **Circuit Breakers**: Automatic stop on repeated failures
- **Emergency Rollback**: User-triggered immediate rollback
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all planning decisions

## 📈 Success Metrics

### P0 Success Criteria

- **100%** Orchestrator planning prompt compliance
- **100%** Blast radius analysis for P0/P1 tasks
- **100%** Milestone blocking enforcement
- **100%** Rollback capability verification
- **<5 minutes** Planning scoping time per task
- **>90%** User satisfaction with planning workflow

### Quality Metrics

- **Planning Time**: Average time to scope and plan tasks
- **Accuracy Rate**: Blast radius prediction accuracy
- **Success Rate**: Feature success rate with planning vs. without
- **Rollback Frequency**: Frequency and success rate of rollbacks
- **User Adoption**: Planning skill usage across the team

## 🚨 Emergency Procedures

### Critical Issue Response

```bash
# Emergency Rollback
/plan rollback <feature> --emergency --justification "Critical production issue"

# Bypass Planning (Emergency Only)
/plan emergency --task <critical-fix> --justification "Production down"

# Retrospective Planning
/plan retrospective --task <completed-task> --analyze "post-implementation"
```

### Contact & Escalation

- **Planning Issues**: Create beads task with `planning-help` tag
- **System Failures**: Use fallback manual planning process
- **Critical Emergencies**: Direct development with retrospective documentation

## 🔧 Configuration

### Main Configuration

```yaml
# config/planning_config.yaml
planning:
  default_analysis_level: "detailed"
  auto_create_tasks: false # User approval required
  milestone_blocking: true # Failed milestones block progress

blast_radius:
  max_depth: 5
  include_tests: true
  progressive_disclosure: true

validation:
  ab_testing_significance: 0.95
  rollback_validation: true
  emergency_bypass: require_justification

orchestrator:
  auto_prompt_planning: true
  complexity_threshold: "medium"
  fallback_enabled: true
```

## 📚 Examples & Use Cases

### Example 1: Feature Planning

```bash
# Agent selects task lightrag-abc from /next
Orchestrator: "🎯 Task selected! Run `/plan scope lightrag-abc` to scope this task"

Agent: /plan scope lightrag-abc
# → Blast radius analysis created
# → Risk assessment completed
# → Milestones defined

Agent: /plan proceed lightrag-abc
# → Implementation plan created
# → Beads tasks created (user approved)
# → Development starts with validation gates
```

### Example 2: Emergency Fix

```bash
Agent: /plan emergency --task fix-production-bug --justification "Production down"

System: ⚠️ EMERGENCY MODE - Minimal planning activated
→ Creates minimal blast radius analysis
→ Enables immediate development
→ Schedules retrospective planning for post-fix analysis
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Planning Analysis Fails**:

- Check git repository status
- Verify beads daemon running
- Ensure proper workspace directory

**Milestone Blocking Issues**:

- Review success criteria configuration
- Check validation tool availability
- Verify test framework integration

**Orchestrator Integration**:

- Confirm Orchestrator script updates
